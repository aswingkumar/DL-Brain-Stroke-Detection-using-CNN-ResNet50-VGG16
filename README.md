# DL-Brain-Stroke-Detection-using-CNN-ResNet50-VGG16
- The dataset used in this project is titled "brain-stroke-ct-image-dataset", which consists of brain CT scan images organized into two distinct categories: Normal and Stroke. These images are stored within a parent folder named Brain_Data_Organised, which contains:

1. Normal: CT images of individuals with no signs of stroke.

2. Stroke: CT images of patients diagnosed with a brain stroke.
- This binary classification structure enables the application of supervised deep learning techniques for stroke detection. The dataset is well-suited for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as it provides clear visual differences between the two classes. Such a dataset plays a crucial role in developing automated medical imaging solutions aimed at supporting radiologists in early and accurate stroke diagnosis.
