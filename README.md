# DL-Brain-Stroke-Detection-using-CNN-ResNet50-VGG16
- The dataset used in this project is titled "brain-stroke-ct-image-dataset", which consists of brain CT scan images organized into two distinct categories: Normal and Stroke. These images are stored within a parent folder named Brain_Data_Organised, which contains:

1. Normal: CT images of individuals with no signs of stroke.

2. Stroke: CT images of patients diagnosed with a brain stroke.
- This binary classification structure enables the application of supervised deep learning techniques for stroke detection. The dataset is well-suited for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as it provides clear visual differences between the two classes. Such a dataset plays a crucial role in developing automated medical imaging solutions aimed at supporting radiologists in early and accurate stroke diagnosis.
- This project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in classifying brain stroke conditions using medical imaging data. By leveraging convolutional neural networks and transfer learning models such as ResNet50 and VGG16, the study highlights how AI can assist in the early and accurate detection of strokes from brain CT or MRI images. The approach not only reduces the dependency on manual diagnosis but also enhances the speed and reliability of medical assessments. With further refinement and integration into clinical workflows, such AI-based diagnostic tools have the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and support medical professionals in critical decision-making.
